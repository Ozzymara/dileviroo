# 🗺️ Project Outline

**Dileviroo** is a fully responsive, immersive, full-stack web application that creates a fictitious online ordering experience through seamless menu browsing, dynamic cart management, and comprehensive order tracking functionality. Designed to bridge the gap between traditional ordering service and modern digital convenience, Dileviroo empowers both customers and administrators with intuitive tools for managing orders, reviews, and business operations.

Built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap 5, and the Django Python framework, it showcases dynamic styling and interactive elements that enhance the user experience through real-time search functionality, theme toggling, persistent cart storage, and responsive design patterns. The application demonstrates modern web development principles, including a Django backend with SQLite database integration, a secure login/signup system with role-based access control, and CRUD operations for menu items and order processing.

As part of a portfolio project for the [Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp](https://codeinstitute.net/), the project focuses on implementing Django's Model-View-Template architecture, database relationships, user authentication, and modern frontend technologies to create a user-centric web experience that meets industry best practices in responsiveness, accessibility, and aesthetics. The project showcases practical application of full-stack development skills while solving real-world business challenges in the food service industry, demonstrating both technical proficiency and user experience design principles essential for modern web applications. 🍕✨

> [!NOTE]  
> While the name playfully echoes the popular delivery brand “Deliveroo,” Dileviroo is an acronymical tribute to my three Code Institute mentors - [Dillon](https://github.com/dillon-mccaffrey-ci), [Kevin](https://github.com/kevin-ci), and [Roo](https://github.com/roomacarthur) (Dil-evi-roo) - whose guidance inspired its creation.
